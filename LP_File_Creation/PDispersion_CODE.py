#  Terminology & General Background for Facility Location and 
#                    Summation Notation:

#   *        The objective of the p-Dispersion Facility Location Problem 
#                    is to maximize the minimum distance bewteen 
#                    facilities (generally noxious).

#   *   [i] - a specific origin
#   *   [j] - a specifc destination
#   *   [n] - the set of origins
#   *   [m] - the set of destinations
#   *   [Cij] - travel costs between nodes
#   *   [D] - the maximum travel costs between service facilities and clients 
#   *   [x#_#] - the decision variable in # row, # column position in the matrix
#   *	[y#] - service facility in the # row
#   *   [p] - the number of facilities to be sited
