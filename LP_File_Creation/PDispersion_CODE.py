#  Terminology & General Background for Facility Location and 
#                    Summation Notation:

#   *        The objective of the p-Dispersion Facility Location Problem 
#                    is to maximize the minimum distance bewteen 
#                    facilities (generally noxious).

#   *   [i] - a specific origin
#   *   [j] - a specifc destination
#   *   [n] - the set of origins
#   *   [m] - the set of destinations
#   *   [dij] - matrix of travel costs between nodes
#   *   [M] - largest value in dij
#   *   [D] - Maximized minimum distance between facilities
#   *	[yi] - each service facility
#   *   [p] - the number of facilities to be sited
